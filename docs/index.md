PHysics ANIMations: 
a (quite bad) Physics render library

The project is still in the early stages of development, so larger simulations will be slow and features are limited. Look at the example files to see what cool things you can already do!

## Examples

A simple visualisation of the electric field can be found in examples/vectorField.py

A simulation of a triple pendulum with the use of stiff springs can be found in examples/triplePendulum.py. The graphs on the right show the energy that each of the masses has. The yellow graph shows the total energy in the system.

Or just a simple double pendulum(looks better imo):
